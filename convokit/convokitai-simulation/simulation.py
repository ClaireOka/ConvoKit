    """Run a simulation and return its conversations as a ``convokitai`` Corpus.

    By default the simulation runs on a local Deliberate Lab backend: the
    published backend container is started (see
    :class:`dl_container.BackendContainer`), the Gemini key is stored in it, and
    the container is stopped when the simulation finishes. To run on your own
    Deliberate Lab deployment instead, pass its Firebase ``project_id`` and a
    ``dl_api_key``, or a prebuilt ``backend``.

    Example::

        from simulation import simulate

        corpus = simulate(gemini_api_key="...", sim_yaml="simulation.yaml")
        corpus.print_summary_stats()

    :param gemini_api_key: Gemini API key the agents use. Required for the local
        backend; must not be passed with a deployed backend, which uses the
        Gemini key saved in its web UI (Settings) by the account that owns the
        Deliberate Lab API key.
    :param sim_yaml: the simulation YAML, as a file path, the YAML text, or the
        parsed dict (see :mod:`create_simulation` for the format).
    :param project_id: Firebase project ID of a deployed Deliberate Lab to run
        on instead of the local backend. Requires ``dl_api_key``; cannot be
        combined with ``backend``.
    :param dl_api_key: Deliberate Lab API key, created in the deployment's web
        UI under Settings -> API Keys. Used only with ``project_id``.
    :param backend: a :class:`create_simulation.FirebaseBackend` to run on, as
        an alternative to ``project_id`` and ``dl_api_key``.
    :param wait_timeout: seconds to wait for the conversations to finish before
        keeping them as they stand. Defaults to the YAML's ``max_time`` plus 5
        minutes.
    :return: a Corpus with one Conversation per pairing and block combination
        (see :func:`create_simulation.create_simulation`).
    :raises ValueError: if ``sim_yaml`` is missing or invalid, or the arguments
        are inconsistent: both ``project_id`` and ``backend``, ``project_id``
        without ``dl_api_key``, ``gemini_api_key`` with a deployed backend, or
        no ``gemini_api_key`` for the local backend.
