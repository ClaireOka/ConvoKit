"""
Rebuild the sample corpus bundled with the examples (``sample_corpus/``).

This script is only needed to regenerate ``sample_corpus/``; the example notebooks load the
bundled copy and do not need to run it.

The sample corpus contains the completed cohorts of one simulated Deliberate Lab experiment
(one mediator and two simulated participants per cohort, one cohort per stance pair) for each
of three mediators: a greeting baseline, a paraphrasing baseline, and a constructive mediator.
The experiments are converted to a ConvoKit AI corpus with ``export_to_corpus`` from the ``convokitai-simulation`` package, and each conversation's
metadata is extended with ``mediator`` (the mediator label), ``topic``, ``statement`` (the
debate statement) and ``pre_survey`` (speaker id -> the reason each participant gave for their
stance before the conversation).

Usage::

    python build_sample_corpus.py /path/to/simulation_results

``export_to_corpus`` must be importable, e.g. by installing the simulation package
(``pip install -e convokit/convokitai-simulation`` from the repository root) or by adding
``convokit/convokitai-simulation`` to ``PYTHONPATH``.

The ``simulation_results`` folder holds the output of the simulation runs. The script reads
the sub-folders listed in ``SOURCES`` (``baseline_mediators/track 1/clean`` and
``final_pool_batches/batch1/Track 1/clean``, relative to ``simulation_results``), and each of
those sub-folders must contain:

- ``runs.json``: a list of runs, each with ``mediator`` (the mediator's submission file name)
  and ``experiments`` (a list of objects with ``experiment_id`` and ``completed_cohorts``, the
  ids of the cohorts that finished);
- ``<experiment_id>/export.json``: the Deliberate Lab export of that experiment, whose
  ``cohortMap`` holds the cohorts and whose stages include ``chat-round-1`` (the chat, with the
  debate statement) and ``pre-survey-1`` (the pre-conversation survey, whose answer
  ``pre_q1_a.5`` is the participant's reason for their stance);
- ``<experiment_id>/meta.json``: an object whose ``topic`` is the debate topic.

For each mediator, the first experiment in ``runs.json`` with completed cohorts is used.
