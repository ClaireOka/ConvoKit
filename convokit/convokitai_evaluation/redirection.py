"""
Mediator redirection: for each mediator turn, did it change what the participants said next?

The score comes from a language model's probabilities. Take a mediator turn T_k and the
participant reply that followed it. Ask the model how likely that reply was given T_k, and how
likely it was given a stand-in instead (the mediator's previous turn, or nothing). The
redirection score is the log-odds difference: positive means the reply was more expected after
T_k than after the stand-in, i.e. the turn steered the conversation; near zero means the reply
would have come anyway.

This is ``convokit.redirection`` (Nguyen et al., 2024) with context selectors for one mediator
and several participants instead of two alternating speakers::

    actual     [participant turn before T_k, T_k]      -> reply
    reference  [participant turn before T_k, T_(k-1)]  -> same reply   (counterfactual "prev")
               [participant turn before T_k]           -> same reply   (counterfactual "delete")

Each participant line is prefixed with the participant's name in the chat (e.g. "Goose: ..."),
the same name the mediator uses to address them; mediator lines are prefixed with
"mediator: ".

class MediatorRedirection(Transformer):
    """
    ConvoKit Transformer that scores each mediator turn by how much it redirected the
    participant reply that followed it, and stores the score in ``utt.meta["redirection"]``.

    The score compares how likely a language model finds the participant reply after the
    mediator turn versus after a counterfactual context (the mediator's previous turn, or no
    mediator turn), as a log-odds difference: positive values mean the turn made the reply more
    expected. A mediator turn is scored only if it is followed by a participant reply, has a
    participant turn before it, does not directly follow another mediator turn, and (with the
    ``"prev"`` counterfactual) has an earlier mediator turn to compare against (see
    ``mediator_previous_context_selector``).

    Usage::

        likelihood_model = GemmaLikelihoodModel(...)          # from convokit.redirection
        redirection = MediatorRedirection(likelihood_model)
        redirection.transform(corpus)
        redirection.summarize(corpus)   # mean score per conversation

    It also writes ``utt.meta["role"]`` (``"mediator"``, or the participant's name), the
    attribute ``convokit.redirection`` reads. ``fit`` fine-tunes the likelihood model (with
    ``convokit.redirection``'s own "Speaker A/B" formatting); scoring works without it.

    The corpus must identify the mediator and the name each speaker goes by in the chat. By
    default these come from the ConvoKit AI fields (``speaker.ai_meta["role"]`` and
    ``conversation.alias``); they can be replaced with ``is_mediator`` and ``name_func``.
